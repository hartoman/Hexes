Work In Progress

This app uses the js canvas API to create interactive hexagon grids for use in games, in the retro old-school RPG style.

Together with the hex-grid, a random map generating recursive algorithm is revisited.

The algorithm was previously used in my earlier (Java based) MultiMapper project.
